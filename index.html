Terry

terry.jpg
Hand-sized Russian tortoise with semicircle shell of geometric pattern. Inch-length limbs and head.
Terry is three years old. He spends his days sitting in the sun and eating. Among his favorite foods are dark, leafy greens, strawberries, and watermelon. He also appreciates extra calcium sprinkled on his meals to make his shell big and strong. He spends hours a day eating as his mouth is quite small but won’t eat food after its been dried out by the sun for a while. 
Terry is a tortoise of few words. He is generally pretty quiet although he has a hidden sassy side to his personality especially when it comes to his food. Terry is a smart tortoise who can do a few tricks such as hiding in his shell or going for a swim in shallow water. 


For the next four pictures you can just put the names of the files, you don't have to include the files in this drive, but you do need to add them to the proper Google Drive.
