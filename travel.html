            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or  <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p>

        <p>Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America’s first National Lakeshore, is along the southern shore of Lake Superior in
        Michigan’s beautiful Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10 inland lakes, and nearly 100 miles of trails, everyone
        can find something to enjoy at Pictured Rocks! (source: <a href=https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm>https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm</a>)</p>
        <p>No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack, and camp
        (permit required). Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see the cliffs is from the water on a commercial
        boat tour. Fall: Autumn colors in the Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking, drive the park roads to view the changing
        leaves! Hunting and fishing opportunities (state regulations apply) abound during fall! Winter: Cold weather brings
        otherworldly frozen waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing, skiing, and ice fishing are other popular winter
        activities. Check road closures and conditions before heading into the park in the winter. Spring: Go birding or walk
        the marsh trail! (source: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm">https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm</a>)</p>

            <p>Harbin, often referred to as the "Ice City," is the capital of Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China. It has
            beautiful winter landscapes and Russian-influenced architecture, and the city serves as a major cultural and economic
            hub in the region. Established in the late 19th century as a fishing village near the Songhua River, Harbin quickly
            transformed into a vibrant cosmopolitan center, particularly due to the construction of the Eastern Chinese Railway by
            Russian engineers.</p>
            <p>Today, Harbin is most famous for its annual International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival, where colossal ice sculptures
            and intricate snow art transform the city into a winter wonderland. Harbin is also famous for its unique Russian foods
            including the Russian sausages and beer. It is a unique blend of Chinese and Russian cultures.</p>
